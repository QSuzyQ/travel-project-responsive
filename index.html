            <h3>Why Graz?</h3>
            <h2>Graz, the city of knowledge</h2>
            <p>
              The history of Graz as a university town goes way back to the 16th
              century. The city’s many universities and institutions of higher
              education still attract students from all over the world. Numerous
              research institutes and innovative companies make Graz a city of
              knowledge, solidifying its excellent reputation as a congress
              city.
              <br /><br />
              However, Graz is not just a place to study, to research and to
              work – most of all, it’s a city to live. Many major institutions
              and renowned companies are eager to tie their qualified staff to
              them – and to Graz. The young people working at these institutions
              contribute a great share to the city’s lively atmosphere. From
              arts and culture to architecture and an extensive network of cycle
              paths. From nightlife to sustainability, from modern domestic
              architecture to urban gardening. You live and learn – and Graz
              boasts plenty of new things to discover all the time.
              <br /><br />
              In 2008, Graz was crowned Austria’s first “Capital of Delight“.
              The city invites locals and guests alike to be part of this
              delight. Becoming a “capital of delight” actually didn’t involve
              inventing anything new. After all, everybody knows that the people
              of Graz are true connoisseurs. This is partly due to the region’s
              mild climate, which offers optimal conditions for growing fruit,
              vegetables, wine and more. However, it’s also due to the general
              zest for life that reflects the city’s southern charm. What’s
              more, Graz is a city of young people, all of them shaping both the
              city and its diverse restaurant, bar and club scene.
