            <h3>Why Graz?</h3>
            <h2>Graz, the city of knowledge</h2>
            <p>
              The history of Graz as a university town goes way back to the 16th
              century. The city’s many universities and institutions of higher
              education still attract students from all over the world. Numerous
              research institutes and innovative companies make Graz a city of
              knowledge, solidifying its excellent reputation as a congress
              city.
              <br /><br />
              However, Graz is not just a place to study, to research and to
              work – most of all, it’s a city to live. Many major institutions
              and renowned companies are eager to tie their qualified staff to
              them – and to Graz. The young people working at these institutions
              contribute a great share to the city’s lively atmosphere. From
              arts and culture to architecture and an extensive network of cycle
              paths. From nightlife to sustainability, from modern domestic
              architecture to urban gardening. You live and learn – and Graz
              boasts plenty of new things to discover all the time.
